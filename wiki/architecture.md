# Architecture — Phase 2

**D4-BT backbone (frozen or fine-tuned) + equivariant segmentation decoder + differentiable area regression head.**

---

## Backbone: D4BiTemporalCNN (Phase 1)

- Shared-weight D4-equivariant encoder applied to post and pre patches separately
- Change feature: `GroupPooling(feat_post − feat_pre)` → global avg pool → [B, 256]
- ~391K parameters total
- Phase 1 checkpoint: best AUC=0.912 at 50% data fraction (Tromsø OOD)

> ⚠ OPEN: freeze backbone vs fine-tune end-to-end. Freezing is safer given single training scene for Tromsø; fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting. Decision deferred to ablation.

## Segmentation decoder

4-stage upsampling path mirroring the encoder:

```
Encoder features [B, 256, 4, 4]
  → R2Conv equivariant (regular → regular, 128ch) + BN + ELU + ConvTranspose2d ×2  → [B, 128, 8, 8]
  → R2Conv equivariant (128 → 64ch)  + BN + ELU + ConvTranspose2d ×2              → [B, 64, 16, 16]
  → R2Conv equivariant (64 → 32ch)   + BN + ELU + ConvTranspose2d ×2              → [B, 32, 32, 32]
  → R2Conv equivariant (32 → 16ch)   + BN + ELU + ConvTranspose2d ×2              → [B, 16, 64, 64]
  → Conv2d 1×1 (trivial repr → scalar)                                             → [B, 1, 64, 64]  (logit mask)
```

> ⚠ OPEN: skip connections from encoder to decoder (U-Net style). Would improve small-deposit recall but increases parameter count and couples backbone to decoder more tightly.

## Area regression head

- Input: sigmoid of logit mask, thresholded at 0.5 → binary mask
- `area_pixels = mask.sum(dim=[1,2,3])`
- `area_m2 = area_pixels × (pixel_size_m)²`  where pixel_size_m = 10.0 (Sentinel-1 GRD)
- D-scale proxy: log-linear mapping from area_m2 → {D1, D2, D3, D4} using Tromsø GT thresholds
- **Differentiable path**: use soft mask (pre-threshold) for training; hard mask for reporting

> ✓ DECIDED: area head is supplementary, not in the main segmentation loss. Only used for size estimation experiment on Tromsø.

## Loss function

```
L = L_seg + λ_area × L_area
```

- `L_seg`: Binary cross-entropy on pixel mask (with positive pixel weight to handle class imbalance)
- `L_area`: L1 loss on log(area_m2) vs log(GT_area_m2), only for Tromsø samples that have D-scale labels
- `λ_area`: tuned on val set; default 0.1

> ⚠ OPEN: Dice loss vs BCE for L_seg. Dice is better for class-imbalanced segmentation (most pixels are background). Decision deferred to initial experiments.

## Inference

- Patch size: 64×64 (unchanged from Phase 1)
- Stride: 16 (75% overlap) — improves D2 detection; see [open_questions.md](open_questions.md) Q2
- Patch logits stitched into full-scene mask via average pooling in overlap regions
- Final scene mask thresholded at 0.5 → binary → connected components → polygon extraction

## Preprocessing additions (vs Phase 1)

- **Speckle filter**: Refined Lee 5×5 applied to VH and VV channels before patching.
  Standard Lee blurs edges and hurts small deposit detection — Refined Lee preserves edges.
  Applied before patching (physically correct; ensures consistent noise level across patches).

- **Log-ratio change image**: compute `log(VH_post / VH_pre)` and `log(VV_post / VV_pre)`
  pixel-wise before patching, and include as additional input channels alongside the raw dB values.
  SAR speckle is multiplicative — log-ratio suppresses it more effectively than subtraction.
  Physically: log-ratio isolates the surface change signal from shared scene geometry.

- **LIA normalization**: normalize VH and VV backscatter by Local Incidence Angle (LIA) raster
  before patching. LIA raster is already present in AvalCD. Reduces geometry-driven false
  negatives on steep slopes (Phase 1's genuine miss was caused by LIA=5°).

- **VH/VV ratio channel**: add `VH_post / VV_post` and `VH_pre / VV_pre` as input channels.
  Cross-polarization ratio is sensitive to surface roughness change and partially cancels
  geometry effects. Low cost — computed from existing channels.

- **Label smoothing**: replace hard {0,1} GT labels with {ε, 1−ε}, ε=0.05 — fixes T≈50
  logit collapse seen in Phase 1 temperature scaling.

> ✓ DECIDED: use Refined Lee (not standard Lee); apply before patching.

> ⚠ OPEN: exact input channel layout needs updating. With log-ratio and VH/VV ratio added,
> channel count increases from 5 (post-only) / 7 (bi-temporal) to a larger set.
> Settle the full channel list before writing the dataset loader.

## Feasibility investigations (not yet committed)

- **Multi-temporal pre-event stacking**: median of 3–5 pre-event Sentinel-1 acquisitions as
  reference instead of single pre-event image. Would significantly lower the noise floor and
  improve D2 sensitivity. Requires downloading additional scenes beyond AvalCD. 
  See [open_questions.md](open_questions.md) Q4.

- **NL-SAR despeckling**: non-local SAR filter, better edge preservation than Refined Lee,
  state of the art for small-object detection in SAR. Adds implementation complexity.
  See [open_questions.md](open_questions.md) Q5.
